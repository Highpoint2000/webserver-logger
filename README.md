## Version 1.7 (only works from web server version 1.3.5!!!)

- Design adjustments for web server version 1.3.5

## Installation notes:

1. [Download](https://github.com/Highpoint2000/webserver-logger/releases) the last repository as a zip
2. Unpack the Logger.js and the Logger folder with the logger-plugin.js into the web server plugins folder (..fm-dx-webserver-main\plugins) [image](https://github.com/Highpoint2000/webserver-logger/assets/168109804/98b38e5d-e58c-4192-b69c-739b608cf118)
3. Restart the server
4. Activate the plugin it in the settings

## Configuration options:

The following variables can be changed in the configPlugin.json:


    FMLIST_OM_ID = '',           // If you want to use the logbook function, enter your OM ID here, e.g., FMLIST_OM_ID = '1234'
    Screen = '',                 // Set to 'small' or 'ultrasmall' if unwanted horizontal scroll bars appear
    ScannerButtonView = false,   // Set to 'true' to display a button for downloading scanner file links
    UTCtime = true,              // Set to 'true' to log using UTC time
    updateInfo = true            // Enable or disable version check	

## Notes: 

If the logging plugin is activated, logging starts automatically in the background every time the website is reloaded. Pressing the RDS LOGGER shift key switches the screen from the signal display to the logging tool. The real-time mode logs the current data record in a constantly updating list (requirement: PI code must be read in). You can scroll through the logs using the scroll bar on the right. You can download the current logging list in the appropriate format using the CSV or HTML button. A stored list of frequency exclusions can be activated and deactivated using the “Blacklist” button.* The FILTER button only displays identified protocols (i.e. with TX information) and filters out excess entries. If the filter button is activated before the download, it enables the download of the filtered protocol lists. You can display an additional button using the “ScannerButtonView” switch. If this is activated, the downloads will be linked to the scanner log files. You can use the MAPALL button to display all logged broadcast locations graphically on a map. If you have an account with fmlist.org, you can either use the FMLIST button to transfer the current log or later transfer the logs from the logs to your FMLIST logbook. To do this, you must enter your OM ID once in the logger-plugin.js before accessing the web server and log in with your access data at https://fmlist.org. Only then will the link work! If the horizontal scroll bar seems undesirable, please increase the screen limit variable from 1180 to 1185 in the script.
(*) In order to use the blacklist button and option, a file /web/logger/blacklist.txt must be created. For example, the frequencies that should not be logged must be: 89,800 89,400 100.80 ... They can be written next to or below each other with spaces.

Users who also use the Extended Description plugin should download the modified version from here, where the buttons are displayed in one line: https://github.com/Highpoint2000/Extended-Description-plugin-MOD-by-Highpoint-
